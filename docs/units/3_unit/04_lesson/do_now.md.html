## Quiz Announcement

We will have a quiz next class covering all of the above topics.

### Discussion

Is there any topic you would like to focus on and cover more of?

### In your Notebook

Rank the following from easiest to hardest:

1. Importing built-in functions
2. Using `randint`
3. Abstraction/creating functions
4. Passing `int/str/float/bool` arguments into functions
5. Calling a function
6. List syntax
7. Return vs print

### Type the following into the console

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
# input: a list of strings
# output: None
def my_function(list_argument):
    list_argument[0] = 'z'
print(my_list)
my_function(my_list)
print(my_list)
```

1. What did the program output and what is this program doing?

### Bonus

Try writing a similar program but passing in integers instead of a list. What happens?
