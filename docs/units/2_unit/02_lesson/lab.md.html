# Lab 2.02 - Can I or Can't I

## In your Notebook

Predict if each of the following examples will produce a `True` or `False` output. Check your answers in interactive mode.

### Example 1

```python
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> a > 75 and b == "science"
```

### Example 2

```python
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> a > 75 and b != "science"
```

### Example 3

```python
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> a > 75 or b != "science"
```

### Example 4

```python
    >>> a = 100
    >>> b = "science"
    >>> c = True
    >>> not c and a > 75 and b == "science"
```

## In your Console

### Complete the following coding challenge

1. Create a "Can I be President?" program, which determines if the user meets the minimum requirements for becoming the President of the United States. Have the user input the information needed.

    **The minimum requirements to be president of the United States are:**

    * Older than 35
    * Resident of US for 14 Years
    * Natural born citizen
    * Print `True` if the person could be president and `False` if they can't be president.

2. Create a "I can't be President?" program. Print `True` if the user cannot be President and `False` if they can be President.

3. Create a "Can I ride the roller coaster?" program. A roller coaster has the rule that a rider has to be over the height of 50 inches. Because of a legal loophole, if you are over the age of 18 you can ride regardless of your height. If you are allowed to ride, the coaster costs 4 quarters (although the operator accepts tips so more money is appreciated).

    * Also, the theme park sells frequent rider passes: with a frequent rider pass the roller coaster costs only 2 quarters. Ask the user how tall they are in inches, their age, how many quarters they have, and if they have a frequent rider pass. Print `True` if the person can ride and `False` if they can't.

## Bonus

### Are the following expressions equivalent? Research DeMorgan's Laws and write why you think they are the same or why they are not the same

`not(x or y) == not x and not y`

`not(x and y) == not x or not y`
