# Project 3: Crosscountry Canada

Using variables, functions, and conditionals in Python, students will celebrate Canada by creating their own unique variation of the classic Crosscountry Canada game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosscountry_(video_game_series)#Crosscountry_Canada_(1986))

## Overview
Crosscountry Canada was a text based video game popular in the 90's.  This beloved retro game
was both educational and entertaining. 
An online version is available to play here:  https://archive.org/details/msdos_Crosscountry_Canada_1991 .
At the start of the game, the player is given a goal to deliver (by truck) a commodity from one Canadian city to another.
To achieve your goal, the player must reference a city-commodity cross reference chart, such as https://archive.org/details/msdos_Crosscountry_Canada_1991 . 
The player must also know which commands are recogonized, such as: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/566644-cross-country-canada/faqs/30240 .

In this project, we will create a simplified single-player version of the game. 

## Details 
### Behaviour (Suggestions for a Basic Version)
* The player starts in one city (random).
* The player is given a commodity and a destination city (random).
* The player must navigate the truck to a city to pick up a commodity, and deliver it to 
the destination, within 30 days. 
* At the beginning of the game, user is asked their name.
* Each turn, the player is asked what action they choose, where the player can type in one
of the following commands: 

* `travel (East or West)`: moves you randomly between 100-200km and takes 3-7 days (random)
* `rest`: increases health 1 level (up to 5 maximum) and takes 2-5 days (random).
* `eat`: eat at a restaurant 1-3 kgs of food  (random).:  
* 'get (commodity name)':  pickup the commodity
* 'fill up':  fills up your gas tank
* `status`: lists city, health, distance traveled, and day.
* `help`: lists all the commands.
* `quit`: will end the game.
* Some possible assumptions:
  - travel is always East or West (most populated regions in Canada are along the southern border).
  - limit the map to have only 7-10 major cities
  - limit each city to have only 1-2 commodities
  * The player's health randomly decreases by a random amount every few moves. 
  * The player eats 5kgs of food a day.
  * The truck's gas tank is 10,000 Litres
  * The truck can drive 100km with 10 Litres of gas (reference: https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/tools/fuelratings/2018%20Fuel%20Consumption%20Guide.pdf)

#### BC ADST Computer Programming 11 Curriculum Competencies - Applied Technologies, Applied Design

In this project, we are creating a software simulation of a real-world activity and within a real-world geographical context.   As you design your game, be sure to research the location, roads, and natural resources associated with your chosen locations, so as to make the game as realistic as possible.  One advantage of software is ease of accessibility by internet transfer.  We are able to share digital creations/games with players who live even in remote or un-noticed locations.  At the same time, all players are introduced to, and educated about, the valuable resources of our land and the incredible vastness of the our nation. 

Sharing your digital creation provides opportunity for collecting feedback, cross-polination ideas, and direct future development iterations.  Find a school in another part of the country who might be interested to play / test out some of your class projects.  Provide a quick survey of questions to relating to their user experience, joys and frustrations, together with ideas for future improvements.

### Implementation details 
* Document the behaviour of your game.  This includes the list of commands, and list of city/commodities.
* First describe the "basic" version.  Then, optionally, describe "future release" possibilities.
* Show this proposal to your teacher, to make sure that the scope is suitable.

#### BC ADST Computer Programming 11 Big Idea - Design Cycle

Every project must have a scope.  This is an initial document or plan of what 
your software is supposed to do, or will do.   Before you begin the design and coding
of this game, write down the behaviour of your game.   You can use the suggestions
above, or modify it to be more unique.  However, keep your scope simple and clear. 
Resist the urge to overly complicate the game in your scope definition.  Once you
get a basic version that is working, you can add new commands or features in a future revision!  Software
development is iterative, and scaffolds over time.  

---

* Create functions for all options a player can take
* Use globals to keep track of player health, food, distance to go, current day, etc
* Create a function add_day which updates the day 
* Create a function select_action which uses a while loop to call add_day function

## Extra Credit
1.  Make the rate of food consumption be a function of the day of the week.
2.  Make a rate of fuel consumption to be a function of the location/climate/season.  For example, colder regions burn more gas.
3. Create a random event that occurs randomly, like a forest fire roadblock, that will affect health, gas, and time.

## Extension
Instead of a East-West only map of Canadian cities, create a map that is a grid (eg. 2x5 grid of cities), or some other network graph.
The game can provide hints or feedback on the routes chosen based on various factors including distance, and time.

#### BC Mathematics Computer Science 11:  Algorithms, Computational Thinking, Solving Problems

Pathfinding is the job of finding the shortest (based on a weight or cost associated with each path segment) path between two points on a network graph.  The weight or cost would be based on some criteria (such as distance, time, scenery).  Pathfinding algorithms are used in many applications:  artificial intelligence, navigation, transportation, game design, virtual reality, etc.  Ask students to discuss possibible solutions and the reasoning behind them.  Use graphs to visualize. 

As our networks become bigger, the steps for finding a good path are compuationally expensive.  This is an ideal job for the computer!
